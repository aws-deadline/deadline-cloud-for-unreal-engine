    a. Input Files. Additional assets to upload to the farm with the job.
    #. Input Directories. Additional folders to upload to the farm with the job.
    #. Output directories. If some directories are listed here, that means that after the job is complete, Farm workers should upload the files in these directories to the S3 bucket and we can get them after that. Usually, there is a render output folder.
